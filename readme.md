## A WEB APPLICATION FOR MANAGING ALGORITHMS IN PSEUDO CODE

**Summary**

Nowadays thanks to the advancement of technology, the Internet has become widespread, therefore available for more and more people. Due to its progression, web-based applications started to take the place of non-web-based ones. We can broadly say that the majority of new services today choose internet-based solutions. These applications have become a part of our life and we feel that it is unimaginable without them.

A student who has already experienced a modern development environment may feel it strange and uncomfortable at first that there is nothing to check or run the program that he or she wrote, and he or she may also miss functions like code highlighting and code completion.

The main goal of my thesis is to design and create an educational web-based application, which is capable of writing and running algorithms in pseudo code. With the complete application it is going to be possible for the programmer students of Széchenyi István University to practice the material of the _Algoritmusok és adatstruktúrák_ course.

To fulfil the aforementioned requirements I separated the program into two parts. On the one hand I needed to solve the possibility to run codes given in pseudo code. On the other hand I needed to create a development interface which, similarly to other tools, does not only offer the possibility to write the code, but it also offers additional comfortable services along with it. The advanced level of frontend technologies made it possible to create my program entirely with the use of client-side technologies only.

The thesis includes the description of the pseudo code&#39;s formalism, designing, implementation, and user documentation.
